# pfp-title-vote-bot

A bot that votes on the title and pfp of the group chat.

Currently only works one bot per group chat, so you need to selfhost a bot for each group chat.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
